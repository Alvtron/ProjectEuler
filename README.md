# Project Euler Solutions in C#
This is an ongoing project that creates C# solutions for the Project Euler programming challenges. The goal with this is just to have fun and improve problem solving skills. If you want to try these challenges yourself, please visit https://projecteuler.net/.

All problem solutions are contained within the `ProjectEuler.Library.Solvers` namespace. Problems are fetched from the projecteuler.net website directly. Within this project is also a file containing a list of all the known solutions surced from https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions. These are primarily used to check if the answers are correct without putting having to bother the projecteuler.net website.

To test this project, you may run the `Program.cs` or use the unit test project.

## Disclaimer
Please restrain from looking up solutions before you complete these yourself. I created this repository because I want to share my code with those who have already completed one or more problem.
