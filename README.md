# Project Euler Solutions in C#
Here are my current answers for the Project Euler programming challenges. The goal with this is just to have fun and improve problem solving skills. If you want to try these challenges yourself, please visit https://projecteuler.net/.

All problem solutions are contained within the ProjectEuler.Solvers namespace. Problems are fetched from the projecteuler.net website directly. Within this project is also a file containing a list of all the known solutions surced from https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions. These are primarily used to check if my answers are correct. That way, I don't have to put unnecessary strain on projecteuler.net.

This project is also unit tested (to some extent). Primarily, all solvers are tested.

## Disclaimer
Please restrain from looking up solutions before you complete these yourself. I created this repository because I want to share my code with those who have already completed one or more problem.
