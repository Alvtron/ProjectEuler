# Project Euler Solutions in C#

This is an ongoing project dedicated to creating C# solutions for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) programming challenges. The primary goal is to have fun while improving problem-solving skills. If you're interested in trying these challenges yourself, be sure to check out the official Project Euler website.

## Project Structure

All problem solutions are organized within the [`ProjectEuler.Solutions.Solvers`](https://github.com/Alvtron/ProjectEuler/tree/master/ProjectEuler.Solutions/Solvers) namespace. Problems are fetched directly from the Project Euler website. 

Additionally, this repository includes a file with a list of known solutions sourced from [luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions](https://github.com/luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions). This file is primarily used to verify the correctness of solutions without overloading the Project Euler website.

## Running and Testing

To test this project, you can either:
- Run the `Program.cs` file directly.
- Use the accompanying unit test project for automated testing.

## Disclaimer

Please avoid looking up solutions until youâ€™ve attempted the problems yourself. This repository is meant for those who have already solved one or more problems and wish to compare or share code.
